## Challenge Overview
  1) This was the largest coding module to date and was the first time in my life I was exposed to Python.  I found figuring out the syntax and different functions 
      to be very challenging
  2) I was also introduced to pushing to and pulling from my repository.  Another simple step for an experienced user, but confusing at first for me.
##Challenge Summary
  The challenges were overome with assistance from our live sessions, Bootcamp spot support and frankly alot of patience.
