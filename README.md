# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Work **And** Module 3 Challenge
## Overview
  This analysis used the voting data from 3 colorado counties to determine a congressinal district election winner and figure out which county had the best turnout in the election compared to the others.  
  Additionally, the total votes and breakdown of votes of all candidates as well as their percentage of total votes were calculated.  Then the same parameters were applied to individual counties to return that data as well.

## Resources
  - Data Source: elecction_results.csv
  - Software: Python 3.6.1 & Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Summary
  The data showed that the end results of the election were as follows:
  
  1) **Total Votes cast:** 369,711
  2) **Candidate:** Charles Casper Stockham - 85,213 votes - 23.0%
  3) **Candidate:** Diana Degette: 272,892 votes - 73.8%
  4) **Candidate:** Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes - 3.1%
  5) **Winner:** Diana Degette with 73.8% of the total votes.
  6) **County:** Jefferson - 38,855 votes cast - 105% of the total
  7) **County:** Denver - 306,055 votes cast - 82.8% of the total
  8) **County:** Arapahoe - 24,801 votes cast - 6.7% of the total
  9) **Largest Turnout:** - Denver County
  
## Challenge Overview
  1) This was the largest coding module to date and was the first time in my life I was exposed to Python.  I found figuring out the syntax and different functions 
      to be very challenging
  2) I was also introduced to pushing to and pulling from my repository.  Another simple step for an experienced user, but confusing at first for me.
  3) I now realize the importance of an organized folder structure as well.  Using VS code and navigating files via the terminal is easier with a straightforward filing system.  It is also why all of my work is in one file (resources).
##Challenge Summary 
  The challenges were overcome with assistance from our live sessions, Bootcamp spot support and frankly alot of patience.  
  
##Election Audit Summary:
  This code could be used for other election data as well.  if one were to modify the file path for the csv file being used and checked that the format of the data was the same then nothing would need to be adjusted.
